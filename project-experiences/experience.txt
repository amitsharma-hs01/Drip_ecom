-->This file is made to list out all the challanges and learning i have been going throuh while making this project , at this stage i am about to start the project and i have the understanding of all major react concepts like routing , hooks , protected routing , state management along with some fundamental node concepts like api implementation  , server setup , authorization ....

-->case 1 -
    I wanted to have a nice intro banner so i decided to make a banner that will turn into navbar , i took inspiration from an online video and made a banner that have some poppig start objects along with logo and which on scroll shrinks down to a navbar . After i started using that same header in different pages i started facing some minor issues like , every time a route is switched the header went into full screen banner state and also i wanted to make the scroll event work only on home route , along the way of solving it i learned to control event listners using conditions and also using useLocation hook for better route based conditional implementation , but along the way i decided to make the animation trigger for only once as the main purpose was to have a intro ,later  i might consider  using this animation as a loader

2--> login and signup page , animation is made by stacking up the login and signup form into each other and managing their opacity and zindex for their respective modes , the screen is separeated into half two panel coulmns and they container the image and the switching options , apart from that the moving cover is a pseudo element of the entire page container

3--> started working with the login page funcitonality , using react-toastify for toast notifications , at first mistakely installed in on the server root.using axios to make requests

4-->using concurrently for running the servern and client simultaneously and also using cors to avoid origin issues as the client and server are running on different port

5-->using proxy in package json is kind of mandatory.Another problem arised with login request in axios previously i made the login api to be get method mistakely and the api behaved unexpectedly and i always sent the req data as response all worked fine after using post method

6-->use the pointer event propety to none so that the screen is not clickable while the request is been made , another instance was i wanted to add the focus features by which when pressed enter on a form the focus should be moved to next input and if it's the last input then it should submit the form , the strategy was to use select all elements of input and then by accessing the inputs array accesing the inputs[i+1] and make it focued by adding event listener to the input[i] ;

7--> for the strong password implementation the color of the border of input on focus can be managed as 
const input = document.getElementById('myInput');

// Add a focus event listener
input.addEventListener('focus', function () {
  // Change the border style when the input is focused
  input.style.border = '2px solid #007bff'; // Change the border color to blue (adjust as needed)
});

// Add a blur event listener
input.addEventListener('blur', function () {
  // Change the border style when the input loses focus
  input.style.border = '1px solid #ccc'; // Change the border color to a default color (adjust as needed)
});

8--> first time i used the second argument of setState that calls a function after the state is updated, used it for strong password evaluation to make sure the password value is correct and updated before the function call,but a quick realization that the second argument can only be used in class component , so i had to use useEffect

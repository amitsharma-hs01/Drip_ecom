    I wanted to have a nice intro banner so i decided to make a banner that will turn into navbar , i took inspiration from an online video and made a banner that have some poppig start objects along with logo and which on scroll shrinks down to a navbar . After i started using that same header in different pages i started facing some minor issues like , every time a route is switched the header went into full screen banner state and also i wanted to make the scroll event work only on home route , along the way of solving it i learned to control event listners using conditions and also using useLocation hook for better route based conditional implementation , but along the way i decided to make the animation trigger for only once as the main purpose was to have a intro ,later  i might consider  using this animation as a loader
